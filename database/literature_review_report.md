### 3. Major findings
The overarching theme emerging from these papers centers on enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems (ADS) through improved testing, validation, and data augmentation techniques. A critical challenge identified across multiple studies is the necessity for comprehensive testing of ADS, particularly in safety-critical and adverse conditions, to ensure their robustness and dependability. This necessitates the development of methodologies and datasets that accurately represent the complexities of real-world driving scenarios.

[Theme 1: Scenario Generation and Criticality Assessment]: Several papers address the generation and assessment of driving scenarios. The work on "Assessing the Criticality of Longitudinal Driving Scenarios using Time Series Data" focuses on identifying safety-critical scenarios using time series data and safety indicator metrics derived from longitudinal driving data. This approach provides a quantitative method for evaluating the risk associated with specific driving situations, which is crucial for targeted testing and validation. Complementing this, "A Scenario-Based Development Framework for Autonomous Driving" provides a broader perspective, summarizing research on scenario-based testing, defining scenario ontologies, data sources, processing methods, and a scenario-based V-Model.

Furthermore, the integration of LLMs into scenario generation, as demonstrated by LeGEND, holds significant promise for improving the diversity and realism of generated scenarios. The continued development and refinement of these techniques will be crucial for advancing the field of autonomous driving and ensuring the safe and widespread deployment of ADS.


### 4. Limitations
The development and validation of autonomous driving systems (ADS) hinge on rigorous testing across a diverse range of scenarios. While significant progress has been made in this domain, several limitations persist across various research areas, impacting the reliability and safety of ADS. These limitations span from data acquisition and scenario generation to the methodologies used for assessing criticality and training reinforcement learning (RL) agents.

One critical area concerns the [PLT-D3: Dynamic Weather Dataset] and [SUSTechGAN: Image Generation for Object Detection]. The reliance on datasets, while fundamental, faces challenges related to diversity and realism. Datasets often lack sufficient representation of challenging weather conditions, which are crucial for training robust perception models. Addressing this, PLT-D3 aims to provide high-fidelity stereo depth and scene flow data under diverse weather conditions. However, even with advancements like PLT-D3, a persistent limitation lies in the sim-to-real gap. Simulated environments, while offering controlled conditions, may not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to performance degradation when ADS are deployed in actual driving environments. Moreover, the generation of synthetic data, as explored by SUSTechGAN, introduces the risk of biases inherent in the generative models, which could inadvertently skew the training process and limit the generalizability of the resulting models. The long-tailed distribution of real-world driving data, where critical events in adverse conditions are rare, exacerbates this issue. While SUSTechGAN addresses this by generating images in adverse conditions, the fidelity and representativeness of these generated images remain a concern. Further research is needed to quantify and mitigate the potential biases introduced by GANs in augmenting training datasets for ADS.

[Assessing Criticality using Time Series Data] focuses on the development of safety indicator metrics based on time series data to detect safety-critical driving scenarios. A potential limitation in this area is the reliance on predefined metrics, which may not capture the full spectrum of factors contributing to criticality. The effectiveness of these metrics is also contingent on the quality and completeness of the time series data, which can be affected by sensor noise, data loss, and other real-world imperfections. Furthermore, the generalizability of these metrics across different driving environments and vehicle types needs to be carefully evaluated.

[RL Benchmark for Autonomous Driving in Intersection Scenarios] addresses the complexities of urban intersection scenarios. However, RL-based approaches often suffer from challenges related to exploration, reward function design, and sample efficiency. Designing a reward function that accurately reflects the desired behavior of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., avoiding collisions while maintaining efficiency) is a non-trivial task. In addition, RL algorithms often require a large amount of training data to converge to a satisfactory policy, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The proposed benchmark, RL-CIS, aims to provide a fair and comprehensive training and testing platform. However, the extent to which the scenarios included in RL-CIS represent the full diversity of real-world intersection scenarios remains an open question.

Scenario generation itself, as discussed in [LeGEND: Scenario Generation Assisted by Large Language Models] and [Scenario-Based Development Framework], presents significant challenges. While existing testing approaches often focus on the criticality of scenarios, they may overlook the diversity of scenarios needed to reveal system defects in various aspects. LeGEND proposes a top-down approach to address this issue by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to transform textual functional scenarios into formal logical scenarios. However, the reliance on LLMs introduces new limitations related to the accuracy and reliability of the generated scenarios. LLMs may be susceptible to biases present in the training data, which could lead to the generation of scenarios that do not accurately reflect real-world driving conditions. Furthermore, the two-phase transformation framework used in LeGEND, while aiming to mitigate the distraction of useless information, may inadvertently filter out relevant information, potentially limiting the diversity of the generated scenarios. The scenario-based development framework emphasizes the importance of scenario ontology, data sources, and processing methods. However, a limitation lies in the difficulty of creating a comprehensive and universally applicable scenario ontology that captures all relevant aspects of the driving environment.

Future research directions should focus on addressing these limitations. Improving the realism and diversity of simulated environments and synthetic data is crucial for bridging the sim-to-real gap. This could involve incorporating more realistic sensor models, simulating a wider range of weather conditions, and using more sophisticated generative models. Developing more robust and adaptive safety indicator metrics that can capture the full spectrum of factors contributing to criticality is also essential. In the context of RL, research should focus on developing more efficient exploration strategies, designing more informative reward functions, and leveraging techniques such as transfer learning to accelerate the training process. Finally, further research is needed to address the limitations of LLMs in scenario generation, including mitigating biases and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the generated scenarios. By addressing these limitations, the field can move closer to developing truly safe and reliable autonomous driving systems.
