## Literature Analysis
### 1. Sub-topics
The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) within the realm of esports is undergoing a significant transformation, shifting from its traditional role as a mere algorithmic testbed to a more nuanced application focused on enhancing the player experience, skill development, and coaching methodologies. This transition necessitates a fundamental change in the capabilities of AI agents, requiring them to possess a 'theory of mind' â€“ the capacity to infer players' strategies, intentions, and underlying cognitive processes. This emergent need for AI agents with advanced cognitive abilities is intertwined with the intricacies of team-level decision-making, particularly in games like Counter-Strike, where economic strategies and resource allocation play a crucial role in determining success.

The paper "Esports Agents with a Theory of Mind: Towards Better Engagement, Education, and Engineering" argues for the adoption of human-in-the-loop approaches to facilitate the discovery and computational embedding of a theory of mind within behavioral models of esports players. This approach acknowledges the limitations of purely data-driven methods and emphasizes the importance of integrating human expertise and intuition to capture the complexities of player cognition. Furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of 'situated cognition,' recognizing that player behavior is heavily influenced by contextual factors and unobservable cognitive states. By investigating these factors, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the decision-making processes that drive player actions.

This understanding of player behavior is particularly relevant in the context of team-based esports such as Counter-Strike, where strategic economic decisions can significantly impact a team's chances of victory. The paper "Optimal Team Economic Decisions in Counter-Strike" addresses this aspect by introducing a game-level win probability model designed to predict a team's likelihood of winning based on factors such as team scores, equipment, in-game currency, and spending decisions. This model serves as a tool for evaluating the optimality of team spending decisions in various game scenarios. The study reveals a pattern of suboptimal decision-making among CSGO teams, highlighting the potential for improvement in strategic resource management.

The development of a 'theory of mind' in AI agents can directly address these instances of suboptimal decision-making. By understanding the reasoning behind a team's economic choices, an AI agent could provide real-time feedback and suggestions, guiding players towards more optimal strategies. The "Optimal Spending Error (OSE)" metric introduced in the economic decision-making paper offers a quantitative means of assessing and ranking teams based on the alignment of their spending decisions with predicted optimal strategies. This metric could be integrated into AI-driven coaching tools to provide players with personalized insights into their economic decision-making patterns and areas for improvement.

However, challenges remain in accurately modeling and predicting player behavior. The 'theory of mind' concept requires the ability to infer not only observable actions but also the underlying cognitive processes that drive those actions. This necessitates the development of sophisticated models that can account for factors such as risk aversion, psychological biases, and communication dynamics within a team. Future research could explore the use of advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to train AI agents that can learn to anticipate player behavior and provide tailored coaching recommendations. Furthermore, the integration of physiological data, such as eye-tracking and heart rate measurements, could provide valuable insights into players' cognitive states and decision-making processes.

In conclusion, the integration of AI agents with a 'theory of mind' holds significant promise for enhancing the esports experience, improving player skills, and fostering more effective coaching methodologies. By combining human-in-the-loop approaches with advanced machine learning techniques, researchers can develop AI agents that can not only understand player behavior but also provide personalized guidance and support. The development of quantitative metrics, such as the OSE, provides a means of evaluating the effectiveness of AI-driven coaching interventions and tracking player progress over time. The future of AI in esports lies in the development of intelligent agents that can seamlessly integrate into the gaming ecosystem and empower players to reach their full potential.


### 2. Key methodologies
The landscape of esports research is evolving, with studies increasingly focusing on sophisticated analytical methods to understand player behavior and optimize strategic decision-making. Examining the methodologies employed in these papers reveals a spectrum of approaches, ranging from theoretical frameworks to data-driven modeling.

One notable methodological direction involves the development of AI agents capable of reasoning about human players' intentions, often referred to as [Theory of Mind (ToM)]. The paper "Esports Agents with a Theory of Mind: Towards Better Engagement, Education, and Engineering" proposes a human-in-the-loop approach. This perspective advocates for player-centric investigations into situated cognition, emphasizing the importance of understanding unobservable cognitive factors influencing esports player behavior. The methodology here is not based on a specific empirical design, but rather on a call for a particular research direction. It highlights the need for qualitative and mixed-methods approaches to elicit and model the cognitive processes of players. This involves observing players in situ, conducting interviews, and potentially using think-aloud protocols to capture their decision-making processes. The ultimate goal is to computationally embed these cognitive models into AI agents, enabling them to better understand and interact with human players.

In contrast, the study "Optimal Team Economic Decisions in Counter-Strike" adopts a quantitative approach, focusing on modeling game-level win probability based on observable in-game features. The methodology here revolves around constructing a predictive model using features such as team scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions. The paper leverages a large dataset of Counter-Strike matches to train and validate the win probability model. The analysis then focuses on identifying optimal spending decisions for teams in various game scenarios based on the model's predictions. Furthermore, the authors introduce a novel metric, Optimal Spending Error (OSE), to quantify and rank teams based on the deviation of their actual spending decisions from the predicted optimal decisions. This quantitative approach contrasts with the qualitative emphasis of the ToM paper, highlighting the diversity of methodologies in esports research. The data handling likely involves parsing match replay files to extract relevant features, followed by statistical analysis or machine learning techniques to build the win probability model.

Comparing these methodologies reveals a trade-off between depth and breadth. The ToM paper, while not presenting specific empirical results, advocates for in-depth investigations into the cognitive processes of players. This approach, while potentially time-consuming and resource-intensive, offers the promise of developing more nuanced and human-like AI agents. On the other hand, the "Optimal Team Economic Decisions" paper adopts a more scalable and data-driven approach, leveraging large datasets to identify patterns and trends in team decision-making. While this approach may not capture the full complexity of human cognition, it provides valuable insights into strategic decision-making in esports and allows for quantitative evaluation of team performance.

Future research could benefit from integrating these different methodological approaches. For example, qualitative insights gained from player-centric investigations could be used to inform the feature engineering process in win probability models, leading to more accurate and interpretable predictions. Similarly, quantitative analyses of team decision-making could be used to identify specific scenarios where AI agents with ToM capabilities could be most beneficial. Furthermore, there is a need for more research on the ethical implications of developing AI agents with ToM capabilities in esports, particularly in terms of fairness and transparency. The development of robust and reliable evaluation metrics is also crucial for assessing the performance of these AI agents and ensuring that they are truly benefiting human players.


### 3. Major findings
The burgeoning field of esports is increasingly viewed not only as a domain for advanced AI algorithm development but also as a rich environment for enhancing player experience, skill development, and coaching strategies. This shift necessitates a move beyond traditional AI approaches towards more sophisticated models capable of understanding and anticipating human behavior. A central theme emerging from recent research focuses on the integration of cognitive understanding into AI agents within esports, particularly the concept of "theory of mind" (ToM). This concept is crucial for creating agents that can effectively engage with, educate, and assist human players. One paper, "Esports Agents with a Theory of Mind: Towards Better Engagement, Education, and Engineering" (arxiv_id: 2103.04940v1), directly addresses this need, advocating for human-in-the-loop methodologies to discover and computationally embed ToM within behavioral models of esports players. The authors argue that understanding the cognitive and unobservable factors influencing player behavior is paramount for developing effective AI agents. This perspective highlights the importance of situated cognition and player-centric investigations in advancing AI capabilities in esports, with implications extending to engineering design and design education.

However, the application of AI in esports extends beyond individual player behavior to encompass team-level strategic decision-making. The study "Optimal Team Economic Decisions in Counter-Strike" (arxiv_id: 2109.12990v1) investigates the economic strategies employed by teams in Counter-Strike, a popular esport where resource management is critical. By developing a game-level win probability model incorporating factors such as team scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions, the researchers identified patterns of suboptimal decision-making among teams. The introduction of the "Optimal Spending Error" (OSE) metric provides a means to quantify and rank teams based on the deviation of their spending choices from predicted optimal strategies. This research underscores the potential of AI to analyze and optimize team-level strategies, offering valuable insights for coaching and competitive improvement.

The integration of ToM into AI agents, as proposed in the first paper, could potentially enhance the win probability models used in the second. By incorporating an understanding of opponent intentions and predicted strategies, the accuracy and predictive power of these models could be significantly improved. Conversely, the data-driven approach to identifying suboptimal team strategies could inform the development of more realistic and nuanced ToM models, providing a concrete basis for understanding how players' cognitive biases and limitations affect their decision-making. Future research could explore the synergies between these two approaches, developing AI agents that not only understand individual player behavior but also comprehend team-level strategies and economic considerations. A potential limitation of the "Optimal Team Economic Decisions in Counter-Strike" study is its focus on a single game, Counter-Strike. While the findings offer valuable insights into economic strategies within that specific context, the generalizability of these findings to other esports titles may be limited due to differences in game mechanics and economic systems. Future research should investigate the applicability of the proposed win probability model and OSE metric to a broader range of esports games to assess its broader relevance and utility. Furthermore, both research directions could benefit from incorporating psychological models of decision-making under uncertainty and risk aversion to better understand and predict player and team behavior. The development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques will also be crucial for building trust and acceptance among esports players and coaches, ensuring that AI-driven insights are interpretable and actionable.


### 4. Limitations
The burgeoning field of esports presents unique opportunities and challenges for artificial intelligence research, spanning from enhancing player experience to optimizing team strategies. Several limitations, however, permeate the current research landscape. One significant area of concern revolves around the development of intelligent agents capable of understanding and responding to human players in a nuanced manner, specifically the challenge of endowing agents with a [Theory of Mind]. The position paper, "Esports Agents with a Theory of Mind: Towards Better Engagement, Education, and Engineering," advocates for human-in-the-loop approaches to address this issue. While the paper compellingly argues for the importance of understanding cognitive and unobservable factors influencing player behavior, it inherently acknowledges the difficulty in computationally embedding such complex human attributes. A key limitation lies in the inherent subjectivity and context-dependency of human thought processes. Accurately inferring a player's intent and tactics is a formidable task, particularly given the fast-paced and dynamic nature of esports environments. Furthermore, the paper does not delve into the specific methodologies for effectively capturing and translating these cognitive elements into actionable agent behaviors, representing a significant gap in practical implementation. The reliance on human-in-the-loop approaches, while valuable for initial data gathering and model training, may introduce biases reflecting the perspectives and interpretations of the human annotators or trainers. Addressing these biases and ensuring generalizability across diverse player populations and gaming scenarios remains a critical challenge.

Another facet of esports research focuses on strategic decision-making and game-theoretic analysis, exemplified by the study "Optimal Team Economic Decisions in Counter-Strike." This paper introduces a win probability model to assess team spending decisions and identifies patterns of suboptimal behavior. While the model offers valuable insights into economic strategy, it is constrained by the inherent complexity of modeling all relevant factors influencing game outcomes. The features considered, such as team scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions, represent a simplification of the intricate interplay of individual skill, team coordination, and unpredictable events that characterize Counter-Strike matches. The model's predictive accuracy is therefore limited by its inability to fully capture these nuanced dynamics. Furthermore, the definition of "optimal" spending is contingent on the model's assumptions and the specific metrics used to evaluate performance. Alternative models or different evaluation criteria could potentially lead to different conclusions regarding optimal strategies. The study also acknowledges the potential for overfitting, where the model becomes too closely tailored to the specific dataset used for training, thereby reducing its ability to generalize to new game scenarios or different player skill levels. This highlights the importance of rigorous validation techniques and the need for ongoing model refinement to maintain its predictive power and relevance.

Bridging these two areas of research, the development of AI agents with a theory of mind could potentially enhance the accuracy and sophistication of strategic decision-making models. By incorporating an understanding of opponent's intentions and predicted actions, these models could move beyond simple statistical analysis and provide more nuanced and context-aware recommendations. However, this integration also introduces new challenges related to computational complexity and the potential for increased uncertainty. The inherent limitations in accurately predicting human behavior, as discussed in the "Theory of Mind" paper, would inevitably propagate into the strategic decision-making models, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Looking ahead, future research should prioritize the development of more robust and generalizable methods for capturing and modeling human cognitive processes in esports environments. This includes exploring advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference, to learn from complex and unstructured data. Furthermore, greater emphasis should be placed on addressing potential biases in data collection and model training, ensuring that AI agents are fair and equitable in their interactions with human players. In the realm of strategic decision-making, future research should focus on incorporating more comprehensive models of game dynamics and exploring the use of explainable AI techniques to provide insights into the rationale behind AI recommendations, fostering greater trust and understanding among human players and coaches. The integration of qualitative research methods, such as interviews and ethnographic studies, could also provide valuable insights into the cognitive and social factors that influence player behavior, informing the design of more effective and human-centered AI systems for esports.


### 5. Relationships to other studies
The evolving landscape of esports research increasingly focuses on sophisticated AI applications that extend beyond mere algorithmic improvement, aiming to enhance player experience, skill development, and coaching capabilities. This shift necessitates a deeper understanding of player behavior and strategic decision-making within the game. The papers provided highlight two critical, yet distinct, areas within this emerging field: the integration of 'theory of mind' (ToM) into esports agents and the optimization of team economic decisions.

[Theme 1: Theory of Mind in Esports Agents]: A position paper advocates for the incorporation of 'theory of mind' into AI agents designed for esports. The core argument centers on the idea that for AI to effectively assist esports players, it must possess the ability to infer their tactics and intentions. This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop approach to discover and computationally embed ToM within behavioral models of esports players. This approach necessitates player-centric investigations into situated cognition, aiming to uncover the cognitive and other unobservable factors that influence players' behaviors. The implications extend beyond esports, potentially impacting engineering design and design education. The paper correctly identifies the need to move beyond using esports as a mere testing ground for AI and towards AI that actively understands and supports human players.

[Theme 2: Optimal Team Economic Decisions]: In contrast, another paper focuses on a specific aspect of team strategy in Counter-Strike: optimal economic decision-making. This research introduces a game-level win probability model to predict a team's chance of winning at the beginning of a round, considering factors such as team scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions. The study identifies patterns of suboptimal decision-making among CSGO teams and introduces a metric, Optimal Spending Error (OSE), to rank teams based on how closely their spending decisions align with predicted optimal spending strategies. This work directly addresses a quantifiable aspect of team performance, providing a means to evaluate and potentially improve strategic decision-making.

While seemingly disparate, these two research directions are interconnected through the overarching goal of enhancing esports performance using AI. The 'theory of mind' research aims to provide AI agents with a more nuanced understanding of player behavior, enabling them to offer personalized coaching and support. This understanding could, in principle, inform the development of more sophisticated models for optimizing team economic decisions. For example, an AI agent with ToM could anticipate an opponent's economic strategy based on their observed play style and suggest countermeasures. Conversely, the data-driven approach to optimizing economic decisions provides a concrete framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies, which could be used to validate and refine the 'theory of mind' models.

However, there are limitations to consider. The 'theory of mind' research is largely conceptual, lacking concrete implementation and empirical validation. The challenge lies in accurately capturing and modeling the complex cognitive processes that underlie player decision-making. The economic decision-making research, while data-driven, is limited to a specific game (Counter-Strike) and a specific aspect of team strategy. The generalizability of the findings to other esports or other strategic domains remains to be explored.

Future research could explore the synergy between these two areas. For instance, a study could investigate whether incorporating 'theory of mind' into an AI agent improves its ability to predict optimal economic decisions. This would involve developing a model that not only considers the observable game state but also infers the opponent's intentions and beliefs. Furthermore, research could explore the use of machine learning techniques to learn 'theory of mind' models directly from gameplay data, potentially overcoming the challenges of manually encoding cognitive processes. Another avenue for future research is to extend the economic decision-making framework to other esports, considering the unique strategic elements of each game. Finally, the ethical implications of AI-powered coaching and strategic decision-making in esports should be carefully considered, ensuring fairness and preventing the creation of an unfair advantage.


### 6. Future prospects
The burgeoning field of artificial intelligence in esports is rapidly evolving, moving beyond simple algorithmic improvements to address the complex needs of players and teams. This shift necessitates a deeper understanding of player cognition and strategic decision-making, paving the way for sophisticated AI agents capable of enhancing gaming experiences, improving skills, and providing personalized coaching. Central to this advancement is the integration of 'theory of mind' (ToM) into AI agents, enabling them to infer players' intentions and tactics. This capability promises to revolutionize how AI interacts with and supports human players, but also opens avenues for novel applications in engineering design and education.

The position paper, "Esports Agents with a Theory of Mind: Towards Better Engagement, Education, and Engineering," advocates for human-in-the-loop approaches to uncover and computationally embed ToM within behavioral models of esports players. This perspective highlights the importance of situated cognition, emphasizing that cognitive and unobservable factors significantly influence player behavior. This approach acknowledges the limitations of purely data-driven methods and underscores the need for incorporating human expertise and insights to create more nuanced and effective AI agents. The future of this research direction lies in developing robust methodologies for eliciting and modeling player intentions, potentially through advanced techniques such as cognitive task analysis, think-aloud protocols, and physiological data analysis. Furthermore, the successful implementation of ToM in esports agents could have broader implications for designing intelligent systems that interact more naturally and effectively with humans in various domains.

Complementary to the development of ToM-enabled agents is the quantitative analysis of strategic decision-making in esports. The study on "Optimal Team Economic Decisions in Counter-Strike" exemplifies this approach by introducing a game-level win probability model to evaluate team spending decisions. This model considers factors such as team scores, equipment, money, and spending strategies to predict a team's chance of winning. The finding that teams often make suboptimal spending decisions, quantified by the "Optimal Spending Error" (OSE) metric, reveals opportunities for AI-driven coaching tools that can provide real-time feedback and guidance on resource management. Future research could extend this approach to other esports titles and explore the interplay between economic decisions and other strategic factors, such as positioning, communication, and individual player skill.

The convergence of ToM-based AI agents and quantitative decision-making models holds significant promise for the future of esports research. By combining the ability to understand player intentions with the capacity to analyze and optimize strategic choices, AI can provide comprehensive support for players and teams. This includes personalized training regimens tailored to individual cognitive styles, real-time tactical suggestions based on predicted opponent behavior, and data-driven insights into team dynamics and communication patterns. Moreover, this research can contribute to a deeper understanding of human cognition and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. The insights gained from studying esports players can inform the design of AI systems that are more adaptable, collaborative, and human-centered.

However, significant challenges remain. Accurately modeling ToM requires overcoming the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in human behavior. Developing robust and reliable win probability models necessitates large datasets and sophisticated statistical techniques. Furthermore, ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI in esports is crucial, particularly in areas such as fair play, player well-being, and data privacy. Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cognitive scientists, esports professionals, and ethicists. Despite these challenges, the future of AI in esports is bright, with the potential to transform the way games are played, coached, and understood. The next steps involve refining ToM models, expanding the scope of quantitative analyses, and fostering a collaborative ecosystem that prioritizes innovation, ethical considerations, and player-centric design.


### 7. Potential research directions
The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) within esports is progressing beyond the utilization of games as mere testbeds for algorithm refinement, increasingly focusing on addressing the specific needs of esports players, including enhancing their gaming experience, skills development, and providing personalized coaching. This shift necessitates the development of more sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding and responding to the nuances of human gameplay. A crucial element in achieving this is the incorporation of a 'theory of mind' into these agents, enabling them to infer players' tactics and intentions. The development of such agents requires a multi-faceted approach, integrating insights from various disciplines.

[Theme: Theory of Mind in Esports AI]: The existing research emphasizes the importance of human-in-the-loop approaches for discovering and computationally embedding a theory of mind within behavioral models of esports players. This necessitates player-centric investigations focusing on situated cognition, aiming to understand the cognitive and other unobservable factors that influence esports players' behaviors. Future research could explore different methods for eliciting and modeling these cognitive processes. For example, think-aloud protocols, eye-tracking studies, and post-match interviews could provide valuable data for building more accurate and nuanced models of player decision-making. Furthermore, research could investigate the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques for learning and representing a theory of mind, such as Bayesian networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

[Theme: Economic Decision-Making in Esports]: Alongside cognitive modeling, the strategic and economic dimensions of esports also offer fertile ground for research. One study introduces a game-level win probability model for Counter-Strike, leveraging features like team scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions to predict a team's chance of winning. This model is then used to investigate optimal team spending decisions, revealing a pattern of sub-optimal decision-making among professional teams. Future research could build upon this work by incorporating more granular data, such as individual player performance metrics and opponent-specific strategies, to refine the win probability model. Furthermore, the concept of 'Optimal Spending Error (OSE)' could be extended to other esports titles and used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of both human teams and AI agents.

Integrating these two themes suggests several promising research directions. Firstly, there is potential to develop AI agents that not only understand the economic implications of their actions but also anticipate their opponents' economic strategies based on a theory of mind. Such agents could provide more effective coaching and training tools, helping players to improve their decision-making in high-pressure situations. Secondly, research could explore the impact of different communication strategies on team performance, using a theory of mind to model how players interpret and respond to each other's verbal and non-verbal cues. This could lead to the development of AI-powered communication tools that facilitate more effective teamwork.

However, several challenges need to be addressed. Accurately modeling human cognition is inherently difficult due to the complexity and variability of human behavior. Furthermore, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of esports games requires AI agents to be highly adaptable and robust. Finally, ethical considerations must be taken into account when developing AI agents that can influence player behavior, ensuring that these agents are used to promote fair play and player well-being. Addressing these challenges will require a collaborative effort involving researchers from diverse fields, including artificial intelligence, cognitive science, economics, and game studies. By combining these perspectives, we can unlock the full potential of AI to enhance the esports experience and push the boundaries of human performance.
