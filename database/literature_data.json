        "summary": "The outputs of win probability models are often used to evaluate player\nactions. However, in some sports, such as the popular esport Counter-Strike,\nthere exist important team-level decisions. For example, at the beginning of\neach round in a Counter-Strike game, teams decide how much of their in-game\ndollars to spend on equipment. Because the dollars are a scarce resource,\ndifferent strategies have emerged concerning how teams should spend in\nparticular situations. To assess team purchasing decisions in-game, we\nintroduce a game-level win probability model to predict a team's chance of\nwinning a game at the beginning of a given round. We consider features such as\nteam scores, equipment, money, and spending decisions. Using our win\nprobability model, we investigate optimal team spending decisions for important\ngame scenarios. We identify a pattern of sub-optimal decision-making for CSGO\nteams. Finally, we introduce a metric, Optimal Spending Error (OSE), to rank\nteams by how closely their spending decisions follow our predicted optimal\nspending decisions.\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12990v1",
