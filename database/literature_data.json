        "summary": "In multi-robot system (MRS) bounding overwatch, it is crucial to determine\nwhich point to choose for overwatch at each step and whether the robots'\npositions are trustworthy so that the overwatch can be performed effectively.\nIn this paper, we develop a Bayesian optimization based computational\ntrustworthiness model (CTM) for the MRS to select overwatch points. The CTM can\nprovide real-time trustworthiness evaluation for the MRS on the overwatch\npoints by referring to the robots' situational awareness information, such as\ntraversability and line of sight. The evaluation can quantify each robot's\ntrustworthiness in protecting its robot team members during the bounding\noverwatch. The trustworthiness evaluation can generate a dynamic cost map for\neach robot in the workspace and help obtain the most trustworthy bounding\noverwatch path. Our proposed Bayesian based CTM and motion planning can reduce\nthe number of explorations for the workspace in data collection and improve the\nCTM learning efficiency. It also enables the MRS to deal with the dynamic and\nuncertain environments for the multi-robot bounding overwatch task.
